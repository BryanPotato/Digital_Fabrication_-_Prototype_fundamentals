                <h2>Project Management</h2>
            For final project, I decided to make a mood lamp. It is simple and is suitable for me as I am a beginner, totally new when it comes to arduino programming.
             
                
            I played Animal Crossing Pocket Camp, the mobile version. The crystal furniture inspired me to make the shape of the mood lamp into a crystal.
                
            Searching through for mood lamp examples on Google, I stumbled upon someone who made a diamond mood lamp which was interesting to me.
            
            Thus, I came up with a simple sketch of the crystal mood lamp I have in mind. The crystal and base will be 3D printed. The box that surrounds it will be lasered cut with shapes and patterns.
            
            Feedback, since I am going to enclose the lamp within the box, the base of the lamp should be a square. This way it won't move around inside. The RGB light is an output so all I need now is an input which can be the off/switch button.
